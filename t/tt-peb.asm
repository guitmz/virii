Introduction:
ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ
 This is a quite old, but interesting virus from North Italy. Its main point
of interest is undoubtely the good polymorphic engine that can generate a lot
of different types of garbage instructions, including fake interrupt calls
and quite long and complex decryptors, ranging at about 1kb-2kb. This should
sound sorta normal nowadays, but for the past days in 1995 it was a great
engine, maybe one of the best around as some AVers stated at the time.

Virus description:
ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ
 As it is quite usual the virus will shrink the last MCB and place itself
there. Of course it will then hook interrupt 21h, but instead of pointing
from the IVT directly to the virus handler it will put in the IVT the adress
to the first byte in the new virus segment in high memory. Here (while on
the disk there are some garbage instructions, this is the 5 NOPs at the 1st
gen) the virus will put a jump to the real virus interrupt 21h handler plus
a word as marker. This is done to make the unhooking from the interrupt
21h chain easier. Infact when the virus notices some dangerous program is
going to be started it will encrypt itself in memory and unhook from the
interrupt chain. But more about this stealth feature later.
 Just after going resident TSNBT will turn into a direct action infector to
be sure that the system will became infected. It will infact search for and
infect 5 files in each of the search paths, starting from current directory
on drive C:, then pointing directly to the file C:\DOS\KEYB.COM (quite usual
on every DOS-like system. Of course this search won't be done 5 times ;) ),
then scanning in the C:\DOS directory and finally scanning for COMs in the
current directory. In this way the virus is quite sure that it has been
sucesfully installed on the new system :-)
 At this point, when the installation in memory and on the disk are completed,
the virus will return the control to the original host. After restoring the
host data TSNBT will create a small routine on the stack and will pass the
control to her. This routine will delete the virus from the memory after
the host with zeros and then will pass the control to the host. In this
way the virus isn't present anymore after the host in memory, sorta stealth :)
 While in memory the virus will check for quite a few int 21h functions.
Infact on every execute (4b00h and 4b01h), open (3dh), extended open (6c00h),
rename (56h) and filename parse to fcb (29h) it will check if the file can
be infected (by comparing to the AV, system files and such like strings) and
then will try to infect it. The infection stage is quite an usual COM infection
stage, so nothing special to write :) When a file is executed before the
infection an additional check is done. The virus will check if the program
that is going to be run is an antivirus or a debugger. If so the virus,
apart from not infecting the file, will encrypt itself in memory, unhook
from the interrupt 21h chain (simply putting a jmp far to the old handler
in the 5 bytes we talked about above), setup the stack so the return adress
after the execution will point to the newly generated decryption code and setup
a small routine on the stack that will delete the unencrypted copy of the virus
and then pass the control to the next handler in the interrupt 21h chain. Then
the virus will jump on the routine on the stack that, as said, will overwrite
the unencrypted virus body, leaving of course the encrypted copy that will
be stored higher in the memory block, and then execute the interrupt 21h
funcion requested by the user (4b00h or 4b01h). In this way the antivirus
or debugger that has been executed won't find the virus in the interrupt 21h
chain and won't even be able to scan the memory for a simple scan string!
Infact what is cool is that the virus isn't just encrypted with a standard
loop but the poly engine TT-PEB that is used for the files is used for
memory too, with some additional parameters of course. So detection in memory
is quite hard, at least as hard as on disk. When the antivirus or debugger
will finish it's work DOS will pass control to the CS:IP the virus pushed
previsiously on the stack that points on the decryptor of the virus in
memory. So the virus will decrypt and reinstall itself again in memory.
 Finally at every sucessfull infection the virus will delete some well
known CRC files of the most common antiviruses.

Poly engine description:
ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ
 As already said the poly engine, the "Tricky Trout Plurimorphic Encryptor
Builder" (shortly TT-PEB) is very interesting. The version used here is the
2.01, but I don't know of other versions before this one. The TT-PEB is
highly based on the use of tables. Infact for a lot of tasks, in the
generation of the main decryption loop instructions, the TT-PEB selects the
routine to be executed from a table containing adresses. The heart of this
method is the procedure tbl2addr that given the adress of the table and the
number of elements in it will return in AX a randomly choosen adress from the
table. A JMP or a CALL to the AX value will then proceed to the generation of
the selected code. This can be used of course also just to select an element
in AX from the table and use it in another way :-)
 The assignation of the values to the register used as pointer, to the
register used as counter and to the register used to hold the key of the
decryptor is done in a random sequence. The assignation of the value can be
done in three different ways: directly assigning the 16bit value to the
register, by assigning first the low 8bits and later the high 8bits, by
assigning first the high 8bits and then the low 8bits. Of course this is done
when the selected register is suitable for doing that!
 The methods of encryption are the usual ones: XOR, ADD and SUB. Only 8bit
math operation can be done. The operation can be done with an immediate value
or using the key register, but this will have anyway a fixed value in the loop.
 The rest of the loop doens't offer many possible choices. There are three
possible ways of checking if the counter came to zero (check check_counter)
and a standard JZ+JMP construct with garbage in the middle to get back to
the decryption loop.
 The garbage generation is interesting too. The garbage instructions are
generated with something like a garbage compiler based on given garbage
construction commands. The main garbage routine (garb_compiler) will infact
examine byte by byte the pointed garbage construction command. The data in
this construction commands should be interpreted as a command to execute or
just as data to the previous command. It's not so simple to write :-)
Let's see a schematic example:

   garb_cmd        db      X1-A, D1A, X2-B, D2A, D2B, X3-B, D3A, D3B, X4, END

 The Xn should be directives to execute some commands. The -A prefix means
that one parameter is required, -B two parameters, no prefix no parameters.
The Dnk are just data bytes that are required by the command before them.

 The garbage compiler will start reading from the first byte and execute
the command X1-A (the adress in memory of the command is, again, calculated
with a table). This will do something using the data D1A too (for example the
X1-A should just store the D1A byte to the buffer where the decryptor is
going to be done or store the D1A plus and additional word or something else).
The X1-A will also update the pointer to the next instruction to be
interpreted, this is X2-B. So then the X2-B, that will use two data bytes,
will be executed, then the X3 that agains need two params and finally execute
X4 that doesn't need extra data.
 In the TT-PEB itself the commands are represented by the garb_rrXX routines
(XX from 00 to 32). The table that converts a command byte to the adress of
the routine is the garb_routines table. Some commands are also called by
other commands, not just directly from the garbage compiler. As you can see
from the source (sorry, i'm not so lazy to comment one by one :) ) the
garb_rrXX rotuines do various things, from just copying the data byte
given on the given data byte (garb_rr00), or testing if a register (given
as data byte) is already used for the main decryption loop (garb_rr2e), or
testing if we are already in the decryptor loop (garb_rr32), or copy the given
amount of data bytes to the decryptor space (garb_rr01, this takes the first
data byte as the number of bytes to copy and the next bytes as data to be
copyed) and so on.
 A command value of 0ffh means that the command has finished or it has to
be stopped (for example if a test for a register has been negative).
In my opinion this kind of garbage generator is very cool, extremely
elegant and easy to extend. The only bad thing i can see is the space used:
infact it should need too much space for some kind of construct, for example
for the generation of one byte garbagers.
 The TT-PEB can generate a good variety of garbage instructions: math
operations with registers and memory, operations with registers, comparations
and the usual stuff. It is interesting that the poly also generates code to
use (in math operations) or compare memory using registers as pointers and
not just only immediate adresses (ex. mov ch,byte ptr ds:[bx+di] and such).
There are also a few fake interrupt calls to both int 13h and 21h. A few
more simple call and jump instructions are also included (see garb_cf0 to
garb_cf5 in source, they are fully described there).
 Another interesting thing is that after the decryptor will be generated the
poly will execute it from memory to encrypt the body of the virus. Of course
the TT-PEB will put a RET instruction just after the end of the decryptor
(encryptor) so it will be able to get control again. When the decryptor will
finish to encrypt the body the TT-PEB will finally delete the RET used just
in memory, will change the math operation that encrypted the body to its
complementary for the decryption and will finally put the real value to the
assignation of the pointer (since before it just put the assignation valid
for execution in memory).

The disasm:
ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ
 Here you have the entire disasm of the virus and of the TT-PEB. Some parts
like the garbage generation routines aren't fully commented since they are
quite simple to understand for the average poly coder. Also I left out many
labels and a few comments from the first hand Sourcer pass. I am not so lazy
to change every label just to hide the first pass :)
 Here comes the source! To get the original compile using TASM 3.0:
